Dear Sylvia,

I wanted to let you know that I have decided to resign from the team, effective immediately. I have been offered a better opportunity elsewhere and I believe it is in my best interest to pursue it.

Please do not be concerned about the success of the mission. I have confidence in the remaining members of the team, and I am sure they will be able to complete it without any problems.

I apologize for any inconvenience my departure may cause, and I hope you will understand my decision.

Sincerely,

Twilight
